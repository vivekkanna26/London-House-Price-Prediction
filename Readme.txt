I.	INTRODUCTION 

The surge in real estate prices after Covid-19 is a well-known event. The prices are said to have increased 1.65 times on an average worldwide because of the WFH culture and the need for good homes has been more predominant than ever before. Every central bank across the face of the planet has slashed the interest rates and governments cutting down on stamp duty combining with various tax benefits has lured everyone into purchasing a home for themselves. The increase in demand has therefore contributed heavily to the surge in the prices. 
The property topic in the UK is one of the hugely advertised and highly politized topic since the 1700’s. As discussed earlier the surge in Prices after Covid-19 is an extraordinary phenomenon because the last significant stock market crash before the Covid crash was the Lehmann brothers collapse more commonly known as the global financial crash of 2008 where the house prices in London went down by 12.6%. Everyone expected the trend to follow suit in 2020 but what has played out has shocked many of the busiest brains in the industry. The concept of buying a house at its fair price has become a Herculean task nowadays and this project aims at analyzing the process to make the buyer get their home at their preferred price. Buying a house is one the most important decision that an individual or a family could make in their lifetimes. 
The need for knowing the exact fair price of a dream home is a basic right of every buyer and that is the major motivation for his project. There have been many instances while our House search when we really felt the need for a reliable source to tell us the exact price for our need. There are many websites in one’s fingertips which tells how much is a current property worth but the very property selling websites only showcases the prices which the seller has inputted in. An new buyer wanting  property at a said location with an idea of the area required and other required amenities should be able to find a perfect price for the desired dream property. 
Our project aims at analyzing the current market trend in the city of London to predict the house prices based on location, total area and number of bathroom and bedrooms respectively to predict a price for the desired house.
